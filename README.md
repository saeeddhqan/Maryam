# OWASP Maryam

OWASP Maryam is a modular/optional open source framework based on OSINT and data gathering. Maryam is written in Python programming language and itâ€™s designed
to provide a powerful environment to harvest data from open sources and search engines and collect data quickly and thoroughly. If you have skill in Metasploit or Recon-ng, you can easily use it without prerequisites and if not, please read the [Quick Guide](https://github.com/saeeddhqan/Maryam/wiki#quick-guide).
The interface of this project heavily inspired by [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng).

## Contribution

Contributes are welcome! Here is a start guide: [Development Guide](https://github.com/saeeddhqan/maryam/wiki/Development-Guide)
You can add a new search engine to the util classes or use current search engines to write a new module.
The best help to write a new module is by checking the current modules.
 
## Roadmap

 - Write a complete metacrawler engine based on OSINT by using the current search engines
 - Add new sources for dns_search module
 - Compatible with Windows OS
 - Web User Interface
