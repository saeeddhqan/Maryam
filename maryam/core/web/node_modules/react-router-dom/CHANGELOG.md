# `react-router-dom`

## 6.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Improved absolute url detection in `Link` component (now also supports `mailto:` urls) ([#9994](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9994))
- Fix partial object (search or hash only) pathnames losing current path value ([#10029](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10029))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.8.1`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.3.2`

## 6.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Support absolute URLs in `<Link to>`. If the URL is for the current origin, it will still do a client-side navigation. If the URL is for a different origin then it will do a fresh document request for the new origin. ([#9900](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9900))

  ```tsx
  <Link to="https://neworigin.com/some/path">    {/* Document request */}
  <Link to="//neworigin.com/some/path">          {/* Document request */}
  <Link to="https://www.currentorigin.com/path"> {/* Client-side navigation */}
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug with search params removal via `useSearchParams` ([#9969](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9969))
- Respect `preventScrollReset` on `<fetcher.Form>` ([#9963](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9963))
- Fix navigation for hash routers on manual URL changes ([#9980](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9980))
- Use `pagehide` instead of `beforeunload` for `<ScrollRestoration>`. This has better cross-browser support, specifically on Mobile Safari. ([#9945](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9945))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.3.1`

## 6.4.0

Whoa this is a big one! `6.4.0` brings all the data loading and mutation APIs over from Remix. Here's a quick high level overview, but it's recommended you go check out the [docs][rr-docs], especially the [feature overview][rr-feature-overview] and the [tutorial][rr-tutorial].

**New APIs**

- Create your router with `createMemoryRouter`/`createBrowserRouter`/`createHashRouter`
- Render your router with `<RouterProvider>`
- Load data with a Route `loader` and mutate with a Route `action`
- Handle errors with Route `errorElement`
- Submit data with the new `<Form>` component
- Perform in-page data loads and mutations with `useFetcher()`
- Defer non-critical data with `defer` and `Await`
- Manage scroll position with `<ScrollRestoration>`

**New Features**

- Perform path-relative navigations with `<Link relative="path">` (#9160)

**Bug Fixes**

- Path resolution is now trailing slash agnostic (#8861)
- `useLocation` returns the scoped location inside a `<Routes location>` component (#9094)
- respect the `<Link replace>` prop if it is defined (#8779)

**Updated Dependencies**

- `react-router@6.4.0`
